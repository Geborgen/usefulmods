# usefulmods
Useful and recommended mods for Skyrim SE/AE. This was created to provide a repository/resource for new modders looking for the most "essential" mods for their game. 

Almost nothing listed here is subjective, they are all bugfixes/QoL improvements.

# Labels

| AE  | Anniversary Edition (1.6.xxx) version available.  |
| Non-mantitory  | I consider it subjective, and not essential for every user.  |
| Buggy  | People have frequent issues with the mod.  |
| Extra Steps  | Mod requires extra installation steps.  |

BE SURE TO READ THROUGH EVERY MOD PAGE.
